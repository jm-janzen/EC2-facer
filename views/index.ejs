                And welcome. This site is mostly for my own enjoyment and elucidation, so it may go down from time-to-time, or throw
                some interesting errors.  If you've got feedback of any sort, please feel free to leave a comment at the github repo
                <a href='https://github.com/jm-janzen/EC2-facer'>EC2-facer</a>. While you're there, you can see how I'm running this
                server - which, in my opinion, is a lot more interesting than what it presents on the surface, here.

                Other than that, there still isn't much to this site.  You've got the four buttons up there (go for it), and I guess
                a cheeky robots.txt message.
